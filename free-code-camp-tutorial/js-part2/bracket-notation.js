// The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). 
// If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.
// However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

// Read the values of the properties an entree and the drink of testObj using bracket notation and assign them to entreeValue and drinkValue respectively.

const testObj = {
    "an entree": "hamburger",
    "my side": "veggies",
    "the drink": "water"
};

const entreeValue = testObj["an entree"];
console.log(entreeValue); // hamburger

const drinkValue = testObj["the drink"]; 
console.log(drinkValue); // water
