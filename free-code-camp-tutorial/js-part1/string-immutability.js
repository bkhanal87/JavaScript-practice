//In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

// let myStr = "Bob";

// myStr[0] = "J";

// Correct the assignment to myStr so it contains the string value of Hello World using the approach shown in the example above.

// Setup 

let myStr = "Jello World";

myStr = "Hello World";

console.log(myStr);

// changing the letter "J" in myString variable wasn't possible due to string values being immutable so the whole myStr was assigned a new value.
